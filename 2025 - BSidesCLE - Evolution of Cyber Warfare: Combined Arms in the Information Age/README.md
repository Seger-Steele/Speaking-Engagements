This talk traces the evolution of cyber as a battlefield enabler, from early headline-grabbing intrusions to today’s hybrid conflicts where information warfare, electronic warfare, unmanned systems, and kinetic strikes are choreographed for real strategic effect.

Using recent case studies and “what-if” scenarios, we’ll unpack how adversaries soften targets digitally before moving physically—and possibly where this space is heading.

Attendees will leave with a holistic view of the history of cyber warfare, a well researched pulse check on the status of modern cyber warfare and how the Cyber domain integrates into modern military conflicts.
